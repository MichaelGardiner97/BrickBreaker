# BrickBreaker
A throwback to one of the most beloved games

This brick breaker game implements 16 levels where asteroids are sent periodically to try and destroy you. As you move through the levels you will discover different power-ups that range from: increased paddle size, lasers, multi-ball, and extra life. You will also discover spikes and decreased paddle size to make things difficult. Try and avoid the bad specials while collecting the good power ups to help move through each level with ease.

If you happen to lose, do not worry because you can save your high score (to the current browser you are using - if you switch browsers, your high score will be lost). You also have the ability to restart right away!
